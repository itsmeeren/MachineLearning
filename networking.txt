	The Seven Layers of the OSI Model

    Physical Layer:
        Deals with the physical transmission of data bits over a medium (e.g., cables, wireless).

Concerned with electrical signals, connectors, and media.

Data Link Layer:

    Converts raw data into data frames and adds error detection/correction mechanisms.   

Source icon
Handles physical addressing (MAC addresses) and media access control.  
Source icon

Network Layer:

    Routes data packets across multiple networks.   

Source icon
Responsible for logical addressing (IP addresses).  
Source icon
Handles packet forwarding and congestion control.  
Source icon

Transport Layer:

    Ensures reliable end-to-end data delivery.   

Source icon
Provides flow control and error recovery.  
Source icon
Handles segmentation and reassembly of data.  
Source icon

Session Layer:

    Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications.   

Source icon
Provides synchronization and checkpointing.  
Source icon

Presentation Layer:

    Handles data encryption, compression, and formatting.   

Source icon
Ensures data is in a suitable format for the application layer.  
Source icon

Application Layer:

    Provides network services to user applications.
    Includes protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS.

Remember: The OSI model is a conceptual framework, and real-world networks often combine multiple layers for efficiency. The TCP/IP model, for example, is a simplified version of the OSI model used in the internet
