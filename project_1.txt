A sequence of data processing components is called a data pipeline


For housing price estimation we use 
		Multiple regression- as estimation depends on multiple factors ansd its single variate
		becuase we are estimating single variable that is price
		performance we are choosing for the model is RMSE-root mean square error
		RMSE acts as the cost functione the d

Observe the data and see for the loophole that causes model to predict wrong
categorize the dataset into numerical and categorical data 
		use describe
		If numerical use value_count() to calculate the no of repeated things
		
plot the histogram for the each numerical values and find out the loopholes 


Training dataset
	irrespective of the other things dataset must be created for thr model
	training data is split into multiple purpose
	and random split data is not acceptable because everytime it generates the new dataset
	which makes the algorithm to see the whole data set (causes overfitting)
		to overcome that problem 
			1 hash based splitting 
			2 random seed generation
			3 stratified splitting
	if unique identifier is used and make sure that no row gets deleted if one row gets appended
	or just create id by combining non changeble like numerical datas in dataframe
	
	stratified sampling is dividing the data into homogeneous sub group called strata
	and right numer of instance from each group is sampled to guarentee from both groups
 	pd.cut() function is used to categorize the values into groups called bins
 
 	housing = strat_train_set.copy() is used to create copy fo the training set and manipulate
 	as we want without harming the original set
 	housing.plot() is used to plot the numerical data x and y axis we can define with the column
 	name
 	correlation matrix is used for predicting the behaviour.
	for correlation matrix pandas.plotting's scatter_matrix can be used 
	after remove the data quirks which causes anamolies ,peculiarities to the model
	
	
	Estimator -any object that can estimate some parameters based on dataset 
		   any parameter used to guide the estimation process is known as Hyperparameter
		   transformer - some estimators can also perform data transformation 
		   fit()-used for estimation
		   fit_transform() - for estimation and then fit
	predictor - estimators that do preditcions
	hyperparameters are just python strings or numbers
	


categorical data handling

	though the model wants to work with numbers for converting to the number format 
		scikitlearn's ' OrdinalEncoder() 
		
		diadvantage is that if there is any relation between those datas then its efficient
		like small medium large [hierarchial data]
		
	One-Hot encoding 
		used for nominal data conversion - like blue,green,red (like no relation between 
		them) 	
		
		
	custom transformer building
		transfornmer mixin - provides fit_Transform() and ensures comaptibility.
		baseclass estimator - its the base class for all estimator ,It provides basic 
		methods 
		and functionality that are shared among all estimators, such as parameter tuninand  
		hyperparamter
			
	
feature scaling 
	
	common way is using scaling and standardization
	
	1 min-max scaling is also known as "Normalizing"
		maintaining that all the attribute have the same scale ie min-max
		transformer named MinMaxScaler is used .
		
	2 standardization is different - "first it subtracts the mean value and divides by standard 
		
		Value so that resulting distribution has unit variance
		"
		disadvantage is that it cannot bound to specific value range ie min - max 
		StandardScanler is used
Transformer pipeline

	executing the data transformation step in right order followed by a final estiamtor 
	final estimator that 


Model trainer 

	after selecting the algorithm just check whether its doing overfitting or else 
	the prediction may go wrong 


	otherwise the solution for the overfitting is 
				
					
	1 Fine tuning the model
		grid searching - girdsearchcv () is used to find the best hyperparameter 
		for training the data .
		array of the paramter is given out of which it selects the best
		hyperparameter
