Classification -yes no true false
Regression - continous values needs to be predicted
clustering - Data need to be arranged to produce output
Dimensional reduction





**Linear regression**
	Continuous values

	Numerical  - number based diffrentiation
	categorical - charecteristics based diffrentiation
	
	
	supervised
		Regression -simple linear,multiple linear,polynomial linear 
		classification
		
	[from scipy.stats import linregress]-> for regression finding
	best fit line has the least square distance between the datapoints
	
	Multiple linear regression

	onehot encoder is used for converting coatagorical data to binary vectors like 'red'=[1 1 0]
	
	
	
**Logisticis regression**
	gives discrete values
	This is used for classification purpose.
	Dataset with one or more dependent variable used to determine binary output of dependent variable
	
	Classification algorithms
		->Descision Tree - each branch node represents a choice leafnode represents decision
		-> K_Nearrest Neighbour - determine the given object is ,based on similarity to the object
		it is compared to
	odds=probrability of happening/probability of not happening
	
	o=p/1-p
	equation of the sigmoid function =p(x)= 1/1+e^-(b0+b1x)
	
**Descision Tree**
	
	used for feature (categorical) based diffrentiation
	
	Disadvantages
	
	overfitting occurs when the algorithm captures the noise in the data	
	High variance occurs model become unstable for the small change in the data
	Low biased tree -highly complicated descision tree tends to have low bias data which makes 
	difficult for the model to work with new data
	
	Steps
	
	Entropy is the randomness in the dataset
	Information gain -measure of decrease in entropy after the dataset is split
	
	leafnode -carries descision
	descisionnode -have two or more branches
	rootnode-top of descision node
	
	entropy= sum p_i*log(p_i)    from i =1 to k where i is the possible classes
	
	shape of the data is (x,y) x=no of rows
				   y=no of columns
	
	
**Random Forest**

	accuracy is higher and training time is less
	multiclass object detection is done using this algorithm provides better detection complicated
	environments
	used in kinect -game console for body movement detection
	
	
	
	Method that operates by creating multiple trees during the training phase 
	The descision of the majority of the trees is chosen by random forest as the final descision
	descision tree is the tree shaped diagram used to determine the course of action,each branch of the
	tree represents the possible descision,occurence or reaction
